# XGBoost and Classification: Predicting Hotel Cancellations

Boosting is quite a popular technique in machine learning, which aims to improve prediction accuracy by combining many weak models into one strong model.

For this reason, boosting is referred to as an **ensemble method**.

In this example, boosting techniques are used to determine whether a customer will cancel their hotel booking or not.

## Data Overview and Feature Selection

Hotel cancellations represent the response (or dependent) variable, where 1 = cancel, 0 = follow through with booking.

The features for analysis are as follows.

### Interval

```
leadtime = train_df['LeadTime']
arrivaldateyear = train_df['ArrivalDateYear']
arrivaldateweekno = train_df['ArrivalDateWeekNumber']
arrivaldatedayofmonth = train_df['ArrivalDateDayOfMonth']
staysweekendnights = train_df['StaysInWeekendNights']
staysweeknights = train_df['StaysInWeekNights']
adults = train_df['Adults']
children = train_df['Children']
babies = train_df['Babies']
isrepeatedguest = train_df['IsRepeatedGuest'] 
previouscancellations = train_df['PreviousCancellations']
previousbookingsnotcanceled = train_df['PreviousBookingsNotCanceled']
bookingchanges = train_df['BookingChanges']
agent = train_df['Agent']
company = train_df['Company']
dayswaitinglist = train_df['DaysInWaitingList']
adr = train_df['ADR']
rcps = train_df['RequiredCarParkingSpaces']
totalsqr = train_df['TotalOfSpecialRequests']
```

### Categorical

```
arrivaldatemonth = train_df.ArrivalDateMonth.astype("category").cat.codes
arrivaldatemonthcat=pd.Series(arrivaldatemonth)
mealcat=train_df.Meal.astype("category").cat.codes
mealcat=pd.Series(mealcat)
countrycat=train_df.Country.astype("category").cat.codes
countrycat=pd.Series(countrycat)
marketsegmentcat=train_df.MarketSegment.astype("category").cat.codes
marketsegmentcat=pd.Series(marketsegmentcat)
distributionchannelcat=train_df.DistributionChannel.astype("category").cat.codes
distributionchannelcat=pd.Series(distributionchannelcat)
reservedroomtypecat=train_df.ReservedRoomType.astype("category").cat.codes
reservedroomtypecat=pd.Series(reservedroomtypecat)
assignedroomtypecat=train_df.AssignedRoomType.astype("category").cat.codes
assignedroomtypecat=pd.Series(assignedroomtypecat)
deposittypecat=train_df.DepositType.astype("category").cat.codes
deposittypecat=pd.Series(deposittypecat)
customertypecat=train_df.CustomerType.astype("category").cat.codes
customertypecat=pd.Series(customertypecat)
reservationstatuscat=train_df.ReservationStatus.astype("category").cat.codes
reservationstatuscat=pd.Series(reservationstatuscat)
```

The identified features to be included in the analysis using both the **ExtraTreesClassifier** and **forward and backward feature selection** methods are as follows:

- Lead time
- Country of origin
- Market segment
- Deposit type
- Customer type
- Required car parking spaces
- Arrival Date: Year
- Arrival Date: Month
- Arrival Date: Week Number
- Arrival Date: Day of Month

## Boosting Techniques

XGBoost is a boosting technique that has become renowned for its execution speed and model performance, and is increasingly being relied upon as a default boosting method - this method implements the gradient boosting decision tree algorithm which works in a similar manner to adaptive boosting, but instance weights are no longer tweaked at every iteration as in the case of AdaBoost. Instead, an attempt is made to fit the new predictor to the residual errors that the previous predictor made.

## Precision vs. Recall and f1-score

When comparing the accuracy scores, we see that numerous readings are provided in each confusion matrix.

However, a particularly important distinction exists between **precision** and **recall**. 

```
Precison = ((True Positive)/(True Positive + False Positive))

Recall = ((True Positive)/(True Positive + False Negative))
```

The two readings are often at odds with each other, i.e. it is often not possible to increase precision without reducing recall, and vice versa.

An assessment as to the ideal metric to use depends in large part on the specific data under analysis. For example, cancer detection screenings that have false negatives (i.e. indicating patients do not have cancer when in fact they do), is a big no-no. Under this scenario, recall is the ideal metric.

However, for emails - one might prefer to avoid false positives, i.e. sending an important email to the spam folder when in fact it is legitimate.

The f1-score takes both precision and recall into account when devising a more general score.

Which would be more important for predicting hotel cancellations?

Well, from the point of view of a hotel - they would likely wish to identify customers who are ultimately going to cancel their booking with greater accuracy - this allows the hotel to better allocate rooms and resources. Identifying customers who are not going to cancel their bookings may not necessarily add value to the hotel's analysis, as the hotel knows that a significant proportion of customers will ultimately follow through with their bookings in any case.

## Analysis

The data is firstly split into training and validation data for the H1 dataset, with the H2 dataset being used as the test set for comparing the XGBoost predictions with actual cancellation incidences.

Here is an implementation of the XGBoost algorithm:

```
import xgboost as xgb
xgb_model = xgb.XGBClassifier(learning_rate=0.001,
                            max_depth = 1, 
                            n_estimators = 100,
                              scale_pos_weight=5)
xgb_model.fit(x_train, y_train)
```

Note that the *scale_pos_weight* parameter in this instance is set to *5*. The reason for this is to impose greater penalties for errors on the minor class, in this case any incidences of *1* in the response variable, i.e. hotel cancellations. The higher the weight, the greater penalty is imposed on errors on the minor class.

## Conclusion

In this example, you have seen the use of various boosting methods to predict hotel cancellations.
