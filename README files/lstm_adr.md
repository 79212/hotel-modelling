## Forecasting ADR Trends For Hotels Using LSTM

Average Daily Rate (ADR) is recognised as one of the most important metrics for hotels.

It is calculated as follows:

```
ADR = Revenue รท sold rooms
```

Essentially, ADR is measuring the average price of a hotel room over a given period.

## Background

The dataset under study is that of a Portuguese hotel which consists of the ADR for each individual booking as one of the included variables. Using time series analysis, let us assume that the hotel wishes to 1) calculate the average ADR value across all customers in a given week and 2) use this data to forecast future ADR trends.

A long-short term memory network (LSTM) is used to do this.

For reference, ADR per customer is included - given that some customers are also companies as well as individuals, which results in more than one room per booking in many cases.

## Data Manipulation

Using pandas, the full date (year and week number) is joined with the corresponding ADR Value for each booking.

1_adr

These data points were then grouped together to obtain the average ADR per week across all bookings as follows:

```
df4 = df3.groupby('FullDate').agg("mean")
df4
df4.sort_values(['FullDate'], ascending=True)
```

Here is what the new dataframe looks like:
