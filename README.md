# Predicting Hotel Cancellations with Machine Learning

The purpose of this project is to predict hotel cancellations for two separate hotels in Portugal, both on a classification and time series basis. Included in the GitHub repository are the datasets and notebooks for all models run. The Python version used is 3.6.5.
